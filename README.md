# RTTY Softmodem for Windows/Linux

This is a simple real-time RTTY (Radio Teletype) software modem application written in Python. It supports receiving and transmitting Baudot-coded RTTY signals using your computer's sound card and optionally controls PTT via serial port RTS line.

## Features

- Real-time RTTY reception with Baudot decoding (basic letters and space)
- RTTY transmission with selectable text input
- Audio input/output device selection
- Waterfall FFT display for signal visualization
- Serial RTS-based PTT control for transmitting (configurable serial port)
- Scroll lock option for RX text window
- Configurable baud rate 
- Frequancy Shift (50-500HZ)
- Multi-threaded design for responsive GUI
